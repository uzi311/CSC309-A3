I have broken the system into

backend: api and web sockets server
frontend: React server and proxy to backend


I have already done the following for you:
	backend: 
		created with dependencies
		.gitignore node_modules

	frontend: 
		npx create-react-app 
		install the proxy
		rm -fr .git # React creates a repo, don't want to deal with nested repos!

		.gitignore node_modules

		The frontend server is setup to proxy api requests to the backend. This means
		you don't have to worry about cors. That is, as far as the browser is
		concerned, the React server is also serving up the api.

To setup on our lab systems:
	pick a system: dh20XXpcXX
	log into that system

	mkdir -p /virtual/$USER/csc309a3
	cd /virtual/$USER/csc309a3
	git clone YOUR GROUP REPO
	unzip wordle.zip in the root of your repo

	npm install both the frontend and the backend

	Configure: backend port
	Configure: frontend port
	Configure: frontend proxy to the backend: setupProxy.js (just fix the port number)

To run on our lab systems: 
	after placing the code in /virtual
	git pull
	npm install both the frontend and the backend

	in the frontend run
		npm start
	in the backend run
		nodejs wordle_backend.js

If you are logged in remotely to the lab you might want to
port forward so that you can see your progress on your local browser.

	ssh -L 3000:localhost:FRONTEND_PORT UTORID@dh20XXpcXX.utm.utoronto.ca

Now on your local browser you can visit

	http://localhost:3000
